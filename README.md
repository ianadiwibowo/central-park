This repository is my competitive programming scratch book. It means this book is a collection of my solutions for programming puzzles that I found from various sources.

I put all of them into a single repository. This way, I can refer to them for future needs. My personal cheat sheet.

Most of the codes here are ugly, but works. During competitive programming, we have very limited time to solve a problem (LOL). Cleanliness comes later, if I still have time.
